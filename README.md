Gatekeeper UI
================

This project provides a web frontend for the [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/psecio/gatekeeper) role-based access control
project. It allows you to easily manage users, groups and permissions for your system.

This UI is currently a work in progress but `Gatekeeper` is a well developed, well tested RBAC solution and is ready for use.
